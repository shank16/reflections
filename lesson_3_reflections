When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Whenever I am sharing my work with other people I want to use remote repository to get updted effectively. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It can enable me to select what changes I want in my local repositoy and what not. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork is a Github feature where you can fork other people's repository and make changes on Github without making any changes to their repository
	clones is used to copy-paste any repository from github to local folder or from one local folder to other local folder
	branch is used to to differntiate your experimental work from the original running branch in order to use environment more effectively.
